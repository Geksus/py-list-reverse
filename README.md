# List reverse

- Read [the guideline](https://github.com/mate-academy/py-task-guideline/blob/main/README.md) before start

Write tests for a function `list_reverse` that accepts a list of 
strings words consists of Latin letters, numbers and special symbols.

Function reverses the given strings in the list and 
their order so that the length of the strings from 
the original list does not change, e.g. if the 
length of the first string is 1, and the length 
of the last is 5, then when reversing, the first 
string in the list will contain only the last 
character from the last string.

Examples:
```python
list_reverse(['Hell0']) == ['0lleH']
list_reverse(['Mate', 'Academy']) == ['ymed', 'acAetaM']
list_reverse(['I', 'am', 'a', 'student!']) == ['!', 'tn', 'e', 'dutsamaI']
```
